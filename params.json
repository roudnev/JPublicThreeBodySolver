Current version of the code allows users investigate quantum three-body systems numerically below three-body threshold. This includes bound states and particle-dimer scattering calculations.\r\n\r\nYou may find Java binaries in the corresponding /dist/ subdirectories, and the brief description is in /doc. You are very welcome to contact the author at v.roudnev[AT]gmail.com with any enquiries concerning the code functionality and the desired features. \r\n\r\nThere are many ways to improve this code and extend its functionality, which can be an interesting experience for a student who need a challenging project in scientific computations. \r\n\r\nIf you are going to use the code in your real scientific calculations, there are definitely some features that look missing or undocumented. Do not hesitate to contact me, we shall see what can be done together.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n  Vladimir Roudnev\r\n\r\nThis project has been supported by NSF grant PHY-0903956.","tagline":"Java code for solving Faddeev equations","google":""}
